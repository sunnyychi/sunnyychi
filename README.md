# 👩‍💻 Hi, I'm Chiara (aka Sunny) 💖

Welcome to my GitHub! 🌸  
I’m a **PHP developer** who codes with **pure PHP** — no frameworks — and loves crafting clean, efficient solutions. ✨

## 🌸 About Me

I'm a 19-year-old developer from Germany. I started exploring **PHP** when I was just 12 and have been passionate about creating custom tools ever since. My focus is on delivering exactly what’s needed — without unnecessary bloat! I believe in the power of **raw PHP** to build functional and high-performance solutions. 💖
